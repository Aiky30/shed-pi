# shed-pi

## Introduction

A package to run a Raspberry Pi in an outbuilding such as a garden shed, for the internet of sheds. 

Automated use cases:
- Weather station
- Garden lighting
- Security

## TODO:
1. Fix: Bug: The script startup gets an incorrect time (Hasn't yet got the internet time)
2. Instructions on pinout 

### Wish list:
- Poetry (Not started)
- ASGI backend server (Daphne)
- Native webcomponent FE with Bootstrap
- pip install raspberry pi
- modular components that are easy to install from a software and hardware perspective 
- Provide systemd script to 3rd parties 
- venv is crucial before installing any third party packages!
- Pre commit config with ci integration

## Installation

### Enable interfaces

For any temperature sensors the 1 wire interface is required

```shell
sudo raspi-config
```

1. Select the option: "Interface Options"

2. Select the Option I7: "1-Wire"

3. Agree to installing the 1-Wire script

4. Reboot
```shell
sudo reboot
```

Sanity check that the 1 Wire data is available: 

```shell
ls /sys/bus/w1/devices/
```

Check the value read, be sure to change "28-000003ebbf13" to the values listed above:
```shell
cat  /sys/bus/w1/devices/28-000003ebbf13/w1_slave
```

### Script auto start with systemd

Create a file in systemd 

```shell
nano /lib/systemd/system/shed-pi.service
````

With the contents 

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Shed-Pi
After=multi-user.target
StartLimitIntervalSec=0
 
[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /home/shed-pi/temp_logger.py
StandardInput=tty-force
 
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Enable the service, (CAVEAT: didn't work when manually starting, works on reboot) 
```shell
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable shed-pi.service
sudo systemctl start shed-pi.service
sudo systemctl status shed-pi.service
```

Read the logs
```shell
tail -f /var/log/shed-pi.log
```
